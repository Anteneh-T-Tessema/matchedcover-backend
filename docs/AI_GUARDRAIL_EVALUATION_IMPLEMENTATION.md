## Usage Examples

### Basic Integration
```python
from src.agents.ai_integration import process_ai_with_safety

# Process AI decision through safety pipeline
result = await process_ai_with_safety(
    agent_id="claim_evaluator_ai",
    task_type="claim_evaluation", 
    input_data=claim_data,
    ai_output=ai_decision,
    regulatory_context=["FCRA", "State Insurance Code"]
)

# Check result
if result.final_decision['status'] == 'approved':
    # Proceed with AI decision
    process_approved_claim(result.final_decision['output'])
elif result.final_decision['status'] == 'flagged':
    # Review flagged decision
    review_flagged_decision(result)
else:
    # Handle blocked decision
    escalate_blocked_decision(result)
```

### Advanced Integration
```python
from src.agents.ai_integration import AIAgentIntegrator

# Create integrator instance
integrator = await create_ai_agent_integrator()

# Process with custom context
